# Broken Balance
 An Outer Wilds story mod made for the 2023 New Horizons Jam.
 travel to the new Solar System to start.
 
 currently still kinda bare bones, just 5 entries to piece together a story
 
## roadmap
- second system?
- actual puzzles?
- more things on planets.
- better art.
- rerendered textures. (planets look as crust as day old santacruz boardwalk corndogs.)
